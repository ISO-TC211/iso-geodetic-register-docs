This document is user manual for users of the ISO Geodetic Registry.


== What is the ISO Geodetic Registry?

The ISO Geodetic Registry is a structured database of coordinate
reference systems and transformations that is accessible through an
on-line registry system.

This Registry is provided under the auspices of ISO Technical
Committee 211 on geographic information/geomatics and conforms to
ISO standards:

* <<ISO19111>>;
* <<ISO19127>>;
* <<ISO19135>>, <<ISO19135-1>> and <<ISO19135-2>>.

Users of the Registry may query and view data and generate reports
via anonymous guest access. Registered users may also submit
proposals for new additions or clarifications to the Registry.
