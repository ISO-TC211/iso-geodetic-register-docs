=== Tasks as a register manager

After a new proposal has been submitted, it is the register manager's responsibility to review the proposal for completeness. The register manager returns the proposal to the submitter if the proposal is incomplete or he deems the submitting organization not qualified to make the proposal in question.

To view a list of proposals that are waiting for review, click on _Register manager_ under the _Management_ folder in the application menu.

To perform a review of a proposal, press the _Review_ button. You may then accept the proposal and hand it over to the control body for decision or return the proposal to the submitter for revision.

=== Tasks as a control body member

If a proposal was accepted for decision by the register manager, the control body of the register must perform a thorough review of the proposal content. The control body then decides whether to accept the proposed register item into the register, to reject the proposal or to return the proposal to the submitter for revision.

If you were delegated the _Control Body_ role by your organization you may review all proposals that are waiting for a decision by visiting the control body overview page (management area).

=== Discussing a proposal

Although the registry software allows any user having the _Control Body_ role to decide a proposal, it may be required to involve all members of the control body in the decision.

Therefore, the registry software includes a discussion forum where the proposal decision may be discussed. Refer to <<discussing-proposal>> for a detailed description of the discussion forum. As part of the discussion, the control body should decide which member will execute the proposal decision once it is made.

=== Deciding a proposal

To decide a proposal, one member of the control body must execute the control body's decision within the registry software. To do so, open the _Action_ dropdown of the proposal in question and click on
image:image-038.png[]
to open the control body review page. The following decisions are available:

|Accept proposal
|The proposal is accepted. You will be prompted to provide information, where and when the decision to accept the proposal was made by the control body. You should add the date and venue of the control body meeting in the course of which the proposal was decided upon.

|Return to submitter
|The proposal will be returned to the submitter and receive the status _not yet submitted_. You will be prompted to add a note to the submitter indicating why the proposal is returned.

|Reject proposal
|The proposal is rejected. You will be prompted to provide information, where and when the decision to reject the proposal was made by the control body. The submitting organization may appeal to the register owner in this case.
