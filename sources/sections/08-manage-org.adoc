=== Tasks as an organization's Point of Contact

Users having the role _Point of Contact_ have the right to delegate all roles assigned to their organization to users affiliated with the organization. Additionally, a Point of Contact is responsible for confirming the membership of new users and for delegating the _Point of Contact_ role to other users of the organization.

If you are the Point of Contact for your organization, you will have access to the Point of Contact overview page. The link to the overview page can be found in the _Management_ folder of the application menu.
